<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Born and raised in Greenville, South Carolina, I grew up attending Clemson football games with my best friend and her dad, though I never imagined I&rsquo;d end up as a student there myself. My academic journey began at Rhodes College, but between my sophomore and junior years, I found myself transferring to Clemson University.</p>
<p>It was there, as a history major, that I discovered something unexpected: a fascination with digital history. My love for history has always run deep, but technology was not something I was so comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I did not even understand the file structure on my computer at that point. But, with the guidence and advocacy of a particular  professor, I applied to and was accepted into Clemson&rsquo;s Digital History Program. After graduating in May 2023, I hit the ground running in August and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<h2 id="digital-history--research">Digital History &amp; Research</h2>
<p>As part of Clemson&rsquo;s pioneering Digital History program, my cohorts and I are uniquely equipt with a blend of historical and digital skills. This means that we use digital methods to do historical work. Some of that work will be reflected here, as this website serves as both a portfolio of my academic work and a laboratory for experimenting with digital tools and techniques. My primary research interest focuses on gender in the 19th Century American South, particularly marital strife in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama. Stay tuned for more on that in the upcoming years!</p>
<h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in Touch</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore my research, projects, and academic journey. I welcome connections with fellow historians, digital humanities scholars, and anyone interested in the work I am doing here.</p>
